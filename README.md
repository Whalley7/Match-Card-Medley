Start the Game: Upon launching, you'll see a grid of face-down cards.

Flip Cards: Click on any two cards to flip them over and reveal their hidden images.

Find Matches:

If the two flipped cards have the same image, they are a match! They will remain face-up and be removed from play (or stay visible, depending on game rules).

If the cards do not match, they will automatically flip back face-down after a short delay. Remember their positions!

Clear the Board: Continue flipping cards and finding pairs until all cards have been matched.

Win! Once all pairs are found, you win the round! Your score (based on moves and/or time) will be displayed.
